# Title of the Project
Alzheimer's Disease Detection using deep learning
# About
Deep learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis uses neural networks to examine intricate patterns in
medical data. Experts utilize approaches including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on genomic
information or brain imaging data to detect minute anomalies linked to Alzheimer's disease. In order
to promote early and specific diagnosis, these models seek to determine particular features that are
indicative of the disease. Deep learning continues to progress, creating increasingly reliable and
effective Alzheimer's disease detection systems.
A comprehensive approach Alzheimer's disease identifying is presented by combining Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While Recurrent Neural
Networks perform effectively with sequential data, like the temporal patterns in patient records,
Convolutional Neural Networks are better at image processing tasks, resulting in them useful in
understanding brain scans.
